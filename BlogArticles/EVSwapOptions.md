# Battery Considerations

## Nissan Leaf
- Most Used leaf batteries have low "SOH" (State of Health) wherein a full 12 bars equates to 85% capacity or more.
- Leaf batteries are small, easiest to distribute, and dont require cooling.

## Tesla S/X
- Tesla S/X Batteries have a longer lifespan and more kw/h per kg.

## Tesla 3
- Can only be used with tesla model 3 motor plus paying a company $2k+ USD to perform magic.
- Very long and couldnt fit more than 1 (if that) in an rx8
